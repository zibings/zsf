# Zibings Site Framework, Redux
Usage instructions:

```
- Copy 'composer.json' file into project directory root
- Run 'composer update' in project directory to download dependencies
- Copy remaining ZSF files into root directory
- Change the name of the appropriate database migrations folder to simply be 'db' (vs 'db.sqlsrv', for example)
- Run 'vendor/bin/stoic-create --site' to create the missing configuration file
- Run 'vendor/bin/stoic-configure' to setup your configuration file
- Run 'vendor/bin/stoic-migrate' to initialize your database
- Create things
```

## Running the UI's
In order to run the UI's, you should use `pnpm`, similar to the following:

### Admin Example
```bash
cd ui/admin
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
 ### Front Example
```bash
cd ui/front
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The first to be run will set itself up on port 5173, the second on port 5174 if both are running simultaneously.

Building either site for production is as simple as running `pnpm zsf` inside the appropriate directory.  When run, it will copy its compiled contents to the appropriate section of the `~/web` directory for you.

## Generating OpenAPI Spec
We now include a script to generate OpenAPI specs and have included them for the new v1.1 of the API.  To see usage, execute the following command:

```
php scripts/generate-openapi.php -h
```

Once generated, you can place this inside of `web` so that it can be utilized by things such as AXIOS.

## Docker Container Notes
Dependencies required for local development:

* Docker
* NodeJS (v >= 16)

To initialize the container and run the services:

```powershell
./Exec.ps1 init
```

This will make the `~/web` folder accessible via [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and the MySQL 'adminer' interface available at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).  To use the 'adminer' interface, use the following connection info:

```
host: db
user: root
pass: P@55word
name: zsf
```

To run the migration command and any other common 'update' procedures:

```powershell
./Exec.ps1 update
```

To run custom commands on the container:

```powershell
./Exec.ps1 php scripts/generate-openapi.php -v 1.1 -o ./web/sui/openapi.yaml -f yaml
```

To run an interactive script on the container:

```powershell
./Exec.ps1 -i php scripts/add-user.php
```

To build the front-end and deploy it to the `~/web` folder:

```powershell
./Exec.ps1 build
```

## Webserver Notes
When deploying to webservers, the site will need some routing adjustments to function as a proper single-page application.  Here are some sample configurations that might be helpful:

### Apache2
```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### nginx
```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```
